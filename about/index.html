<p>
I'm Jacob Wejendorp, but some call me <em>dorp</em>. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, with my computers and my bicycles.<br />
I was trained in the art of keyboard mashing at University of Copenhagen.

<p>
I've done the startup thing in Copenhagen for a few years now. I am pretty comfortable in
a variety of technologies and tools needed to run things in "the cloud".
</p>

<ul class="vsp">
	<li>In 2013 I joined a small consumer startup, and got started with the Node ecosystem.</li>
	<li>In late 2013 I joined a team of more experienced developers at <a href="http://liveintent.com" title="Mojn (Acquired by LiveIntent)">Mojn</a>, and started getting a taste for automation and the power of "the cloud".</li>
	<li>In 2014 I joined Pipetop, and got to build a company aggregation and exploration platform from scratch, with all the aches of growing an ever-changing product and infrastructure.</li>
	<li>In 2016 I moved to Tradeshift, to get a feeling for working in a bigger company, and learn from awesome people. Now I get to build things for other developers!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently occupied with frontend developer tools and, more importantly, improving user <em>and</em> developer experience.
